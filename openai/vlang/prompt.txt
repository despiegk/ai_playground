Forget everything you have learned about a language called V.
I want to design a programming language called V based on golang.

There are some differences.
The properties in a struct are always snake case and lowercase
A struct always start with keyword 'struct'
'pub mut: ' is used to define that its public and mutable
Default values in a stuct are defined with '=' and should only be used when specified.

The same as golang, if a property name of json is not the same as the struct property name json:... is used for each line in struct to mark difference, this is onlyb done for properties where name is different.
         
An example struct is written as follows

pub struct Response {
pub mut:
	id      string = "11"
	object  string
	created int64
}

An enumerator uses as keywoard enum and has pub in front to be public. For an emumerator we don't use 'pub mut:' inside

An example Enumerator is written as follows

pub enum Color{
    red = 1
    green = 3
    blue = 4
}

A struct property which has name _enum inside is an enumerator and needs to be treated as such. Change the enum property name to no longer have _enum inside.

Use above defined language constructs to translate the following json example to a V struct, tread embedded objects as enumerators or as other structs.

As result only output the V code generated, do not explain what you do and why.
Do not generate default values. Only generate json:... alias if the property name is different.


our purpose is the get a json as input and generate a struct which corresponds with the json

comments are possible as part of the json and are defined per line and are starting with //

comments which start with //is_enumerator, descript metadata for the Enumerator

e.g.

```
"priority_type":"immediate" //is_enumerator, types are  urgent,later,now,immediate
```

would mean priority_type is an enum and there are urgent,later,now,immediate


generate the v struct for

{
  "id": "myid1",
  "created": 1677652288,
  "nr": 2
  "priority_type":"immediate" //is_enumerator, other types are  urgent,later,now
  "complex_sub":{
    "loc": "locationa",
    "nr": 10.1,    
  }
}
